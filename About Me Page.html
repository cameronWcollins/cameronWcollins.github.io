  <div class="AboutMeContent">  

  <p>I have always had a passion for for music. When I was little, I loved to listen to music because I felt as if I was transported into a different world. As I grew older, I realized that music has great power, the kinda of power that can change a person's mood within seconds. My first instrument was the piano. I took lessons on the piano all the way through 6th grade. In 5th grade I began playing the trumpet. I choose the trumpet as my band instrument because it has a distinct sound that can resonate for miles, making it known to everyone around of its presence. I have now been playing the trumpet for over five years and particapate in my school's Jazz, and Honor's Symphonic Bands</p>
